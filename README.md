## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I added more information about working with SVGs.

### Continued development

- I still have issues with positioning the background images but quite happy with the evolution.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - There is one of my favourite resource. Any question that I may have, there is another person who had struggled with it, highest probability if not always, I find it here. Plus there is more than one person who have tried to answer to that question. Hence I get more answers than I bargained for.
- [Google](https://www.google.com) - I am a big user of this resource and I am not ashamed to admit it.
